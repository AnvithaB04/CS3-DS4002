# üê∂üê± Pet Breed Classification Case Study

This project classifies 35 breeds of dogs and cats using deep learning and transfer learning. It uses the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset and applies a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model for high-accuracy breed identification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Producing Results

**Step 1: Download Data**
- Go to [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)
- Download `images.tar.gz` and extract into `DATA/`

**Step 2: Organize and Preprocess**
```bash
python SCRIPTS/data_organization.py
python SCRIPTS/data_preprocessing.py
```

**Step 3: Train & Evaluate the Model in Colab**  
   - Mount Google¬†Drive or upload the `DATA/organized_images/` directory to Colab.  
   - Run all cells in `Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb`.  

**Step 4: Inspect Results**  
   - Review training/validation performance in the output graphs.
